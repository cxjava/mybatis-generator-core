Overview
--------
MyBatis Generator (MBG) is a code generator for the MyBatis (and iBATIS) SQL
mapping framefork.  MBG will introspect database tables (through JDBC
DatabaseMetaData) and generate SQL Map XML files, Java model object (POJOs)
that match the table, and (optionally) Java client classes that use the other
generated objects.

For full documentation, please refer to the user's manual at
doc/html/index.html in this distribution.

Dependencies
------------
There are no dependencies beyond the JRE.  JRE 5.0 or above is required.
Also required is a JDBC driver that implements the DatabaseMetaData interface,
especially the "getColumns" and "getPrimaryKeys" methods.
